# My Chats

Similar idea to [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier), but just the way I like it ðŸ˜€.

To change apps you plan to install modify ```myApplist/applist.txt``` and add the required png with the same name in lowercase.

## Install

Works using deb and apt, only available on Debian based systems. 

Requires ```nodejs```

```
git clone https://github.com/connbrack/my-chat-app.git
cd my-chat-app
bash create_apps.sh
```
After completing you may remove the git folder
